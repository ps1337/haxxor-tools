shell:
  label: Shell
  description: |
    It can be used to break out from restricted environments by spawning an
    interactive system shell.

command:
  label: Command
  description: |
    It can be used to break out from restricted environments by running
    non-interactive system commands.

reverse-shell:
  label: Reverse shell
  description: |
    It can send back a reverse shell to a listening attacker to open a remote
    network access.

non-interactive-reverse-shell:
  label: Non-interactive reverse shell
  description: |
    It can send back a non-interactive reverse shell to a listening attacker to
    open a remote network access.

bind-shell:
  label: Bind shell
  description: |
    It can bind a shell to a local port to allow remote network access.

non-interactive-bind-shell:
  label: Non-interactive bind shell
  description: |
    It can bind a non-interactive shell to a local port to allow remote network
    access.

file-upload:
  label: File upload
  description: |
    It can exfiltrate files on the network.

file-download:
  label: File download
  description: |
    It can download remote files.

file-write:
  label: File write
  description: |
    It writes data to files, it may be used to do privileged writes or write
    files outside a restricted file system.

file-read:
  label: File read
  description: |
    It reads data from files, it may be used to do privileged reads or disclose
    files outside a restricted file system.

library-load:
  label: Library load
  description: |
    It loads shared libraries that may be used to run code in the binary
    execution context.

suid:
  label: SUID
  description: |
    It runs with the SUID bit set and may be exploited to access the file
    system, escalate or maintain access with elevated privileges working as a
    SUID backdoor. If it is used to run `sh -p`, omit the `-p` argument on systems
    like Debian that allow the default `sh` shell to run with SUID privileges.

sudo:
  label: Sudo
  description: |
    It runs in privileged context and may be used to access the file system,
    escalate or maintain access with elevated privileges if enabled on `sudo`.

capabilities:
  label: Capabilities
  description: |
    It can manipulate its process UID and can be used on Linux as a backdoor to maintain
    elevated privileges with the `CAP_SETUID` capability set. This also works when executed
    by another binary with the capability set.

limited-suid:
  label: Limited SUID
  description: |
    It runs with the SUID bit set and may be exploited to access the file
    system, escalate or maintain access with elevated privileges working as a
    SUID backdoor. If it is used to run commands it only works on systems
    like Debian that allow the default `sh` shell to run with SUID privileges.
